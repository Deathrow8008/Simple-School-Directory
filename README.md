# Simple-School-Directory
The project is to be able to create an application that can run a client/server architecture and have the database to be hosted on Php MyAdmin. The project is implemented using sockets and the use of a database to hold basic information keyed in by the user for later access. To implement the Client/server Architecture, the Client is anyone who has our source code, and the server is the host that has the source code and the database together. To be able to enable concurrent access, we have one workstation work as a server and the other clients will have to use the Workstation’s Ip address to interact concurrently.
This report discusses a simple client server application based on the idea of the server side
hosting the database in which the data is stored and readily available for the client upon request.
Yellow Pages was implemented using a high level programming language Java, and integrated
with MySQL. The application should be able to run concurrently having the ability to interact
with multiple users connecting to the database without hindering performance.
The objective of this application is to act as a directory, whereby the user searches, deletes and
adds information within the directory. The purposes of this project is to create a platform in the
form of a directory to allow the various users either to search, add or delete information from the
database. The directory is to have information of either an individual; who may be a company or
an organization’s representative, or personal information and either institution details to enable
ease of communication and to find the necessary information needed.
This report shows the procedures for the project, the project results’ and analysis of the results
recorded.
